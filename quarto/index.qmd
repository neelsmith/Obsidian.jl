> â˜ž *Work with [Obsidian vaults](https://obsidian.md) in  Julia*.

If you love the Obsidian app, but don't love javascript, `Obsidian.jl` gives you access to the structure  of an Obsidian vault similar to the model of the Obsidian app.With `Obsidian.jl`, you can explore the graph of a vault base on:

- incoming and outgoing links for a note
- Obsidian tags occuring on a note
- key-value pairs in the notation defined by
 the [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

 You can also extract the Markdown content of a note, and can export an entire vault to a directory tree of Markdown files with wikilinks converted to relative links.
