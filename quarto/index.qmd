> â˜ž *Work with [Obsidian vaults](https://obsidian.md) in  Julia*.

If you love the Obsidian app, but don't love javascript, `Obsidian.jl` gives you programmatic access to an Obsidian vault similar to the app: you can find incoming and outgoing links to pages,  tags occurring on pages or all tags on a page.

In addition, it indexes inline fields with key-value pairs in the notation defined by
 the [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).

## Status
