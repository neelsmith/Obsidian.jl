Dear Bill:

  

As I have not written to you for a long time, I suppose you have been wondering what has become of me. I have been at home since the midst of last December - have written to you once or twice during the time, but have not received a line in return from you. I received license to preach at our first Quarterly Meeting held in January. I have preached three times since and have been traveling around with bro. Crenshaw on this Circuit several times. What I will do now I cannot tell. Crenshaw told me a short tine ago, that he wanted me as a Junior preacher on this Circuit. Whether the Quarterly Conference will receive another preacher I cannot tell. I will accept the appointment very willingly if offered to me, I will have to preach twice or three times a week, and that you know, will keep me busy as my stock of sermons is small, and no one to rely on  but myself for assistance. I want you to send me some pretty ample notes, send as many as you well can. They will help me and very much. I would like to go down to see you and my friends in Clarke, this summer, but I don’t think I can do so. I am rather afraid to venture down that close to the Yankees. Am afraid they might catch me and Coly. Bro. Crenshaw is very anxious for you to come up this summer so you can preach for him. If I remain on this circ. -- i.e. circuit --  I am in hopes the Yankees will run you off for awhile so you can come up and preach for me. I think I will like circuit riding pretty well. If I can only keep from falling in love with some of the pretty women Bill you know all about such things, from experience, so I need not say anything about such things to you. Didn't you tell me that Frank [1051] said she was going to select me a sweetheart? I suppose I will have to wait for her. Tell Frank I am anxious to see her. Give her my best regards, etc. I cannot tell why it is that you have received no letters from home Some of us have been writing to you every few weeks ever since you were married. You may not get this so I think it hardly worthwhile to write much. A letter came here for you some time in the winter from your correspondent Mollie. I thought it was no use to send it to you then, I will send it with this if I can find it - if not the next time I write. It contained a present which I will not send to you - will keep it  till you come here. If you get this letter I want you to remember me to all my Clarke Friends and especially to Miss Sue. How are all at Mr. Strothers and bro. Frank Greene's? Does Frank G. laugh at you any more about "poor Job"? I saw sister Crenshaw yesterday and told her what you wrote in Ginnie's letter. She said she was going to write to her father and direct to Markham, If you know him and any letters come there for him have them forwarded. She requested me to tell you to do so, as her father does not live very close to Markham he might not get them if any comes, write soon am send those notes without fail.

  

Affectionately Yours,

Wes
